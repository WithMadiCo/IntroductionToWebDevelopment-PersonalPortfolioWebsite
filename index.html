								<h2>Goal 1</h2>
								<p><i>I will incorporate a variety of literary skills within math to enhance learning.</i><br>
								<br> <b>Activities/Actions: </b> I will accomplish this by highlighting the literacy components
								 of the MVP curriculum in both my Precalculus and Math 3 classes.
								<br>
								<br> <b>Expected Outcomes/Evidence of Completion: </b> Students will have better understanding
								of not only the "what" of mathematics but also the "why" behind the mathematics. This
								will allow the students to develop their analytical and communication skills on a deeper
								level. This will be evident through students' logical arguments and reasoning in both oral
								 and written classwork and assignments.
								<br>
								<br> <b> Resources Needed: </b> MVP curriculum
								<br>
								<br> <b> Timeline: </b> August 2018 - June 2019</p>

								<h2>Goal 2</h2>
								<p><i>The Precalculus Math PLC will adopt strategies from the framework of culturally responsive teaching to develop focused purposeful instruction.</i><br>
								<br> <b>Activities/Actions: </b> I will meet with the Honors Pre-Calculus PLC to develop
								instruction that that follows the culturally responsive teaching
								 strategies. As a team, we will monitor student performance using formative and common
								  summative assessments, especially our targeted subgroups.
								<br>
								<br> <b>Expected Outcomes/Evidence of Completion: </b> We hope to see improvement in student
								performance in our targeted subgroups by using research based strategies in the classroom.
								<br>
								<br> <b> Resources Needed: </b> PLC Time, Data Discussion Time, Instructional Support, PD from Literacy Coach
								<br>
								<br> <b> Timeline: </b> August 2018-June 2019</p>
